# OnTrack - First Time Setup (After Clone)

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 steps)

After cloning this repo, run these 3 commands:

```bash
# 1. Generate .env file with secure secrets
./setup-env.sh

# 2. Start the application
docker compose up -d

# 3. Verify it's running
curl http://localhost/health
```

**Done!** Access at http://localhost

## 📝 What These Steps Do

### Step 1: `./setup-env.sh`
- Creates `.env` file from `.env.example` template
- Generates secure random JWT secrets (32 bytes)
- Generates secure database passwords
- **Why needed**: `.env` contains secrets and is excluded from git

### Step 2: `docker compose up -d`
- Builds Docker images (backend, frontend)
- Starts all services (PostgreSQL, Redis, NextCloud, Backend, Frontend, Nginx)
- Creates database tables automatically
- Seeds initial admin user

### Step 3: Test endpoint
- Verifies backend is healthy and responding

## 🔐 Default Credentials

After setup completes, login with:

```
Username: Admin
Password: AdminAdmin@123
Email: admin@ontrack.local
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Change this password immediately after first login!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "setup-env.sh: Permission denied"
```bash
chmod +x setup-env.sh
./setup-env.sh
```

### Issue: "docker: command not found"
Install Docker first: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

### Issue: "Port 80 already in use"
```bash
# Option 1: Stop conflicting service
sudo lsof -i :80

# Option 2: Change port in .env
echo "NGINX_PORT=8080" >> .env
# Then access at http://localhost:8080
```

### Issue: Backend unhealthy / not starting
```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs backend

# Common fix: rebuild
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### Issue: "JWT_SECRET is not defined"
```bash
# Re-run setup
./setup-env.sh

# Restart containers
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
# View all logs
docker compose logs -f

# View backend logs only
docker compose logs -f backend

# Restart a service
docker compose restart backend

# Stop all services
docker compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (fresh start)
docker compose down -v

# Rebuild specific service
docker compose build --no-cache backend
docker compose up -d backend
```

3. **Use HTTPS in production** - see `1st-audit.md` for SSL setup
4. **Review security fixes** in `1st-audit.md` before production
